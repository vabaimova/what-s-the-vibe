# What's the Vibe?

A simple web application to generate a moodboard of images based on a user's text input.

## How it works

1.  The user enters a description of a "vibe" (e.g., "cozy autumn morning").
2.  The application fetches public domain images from the [Pixabay API](https://pixabay.com/api/).
3.  It displays the images in a grid, creating a visual moodboard.
4.  A list of sources for each image is provided at the bottom of the page.
